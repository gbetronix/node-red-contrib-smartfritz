Please make sure to give some critical feedback. :)

## Installation
Use `npm install node-red-contrib-smartfritz` to install.

## Usage
This package provides nodes to read and write signals to Fritz!Dect 200 switches via Node-RED. The configuration node lets you setup your Fritz!Box account and Actor Identification (AID).

The fritz read node is used to read the switch state (1/on, 0/off) from a Fritz!Dect 200 device. **Make sure to use a valid AID.** The message contains the info structure in `msg.payload`.

The fritz write node is used to write the switch state (1/on, 0/off) from a Fritz!Dect 200 device. **Make sure to use a valid AID.** The message can contain boolean or string values in `msg.payload`.
